# motoriders_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Windows (desktop) setup ⚠️

If you plan to run this Flutter application on Windows (desktop), ensure you have the Visual Studio C++ toolset installed. If you see this error while running `flutter run -d windows`:

```
No CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER could be found.
```

Follow the Windows setup & troubleshooting guide in `docs/windows-setup.md`. It explains how to install the required Visual Studio workloads (Desktop development with C++) and the steps to validate your environment.

Tip: While you fix Windows desktop support you can still run the app in web (Chrome/Edge) using `flutter run -d chrome`.
